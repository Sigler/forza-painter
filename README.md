Still, please consider getting Discord and joining as we have a growing library of handmade vinyl groups being shared.

### What is this for?:
Any image ‚Üí Forza (Vinyl Group)

### Does this work for the Steam versions or the Microsoft Store versions?
It supports both! And it should work for older and future releases too thanks to some magic under the hood.

### How does it work?:
When you drag one or multiple images onto `forza-painter.exe`; It will break the image(s) down into shapes and store them in `.json` data files.
Then you drag those `.json` data files onto `forza-painter.exe`; It deserializes this `.json` and uses some math, reverse engineering and the Windows API to push these shapes into FH5 automagically.

# FAQ:
- **Will this get me banned!?**
```
To preface this:
I take no responsibility for your use of this software.

You may be reported by players if you share the vinyls as they are extremely
detailed. Some players feel that making vinyl groups in this way is unfair as
they have had to suffer through learning the tool and were not able to use an
easy starting point.

This is a completely valid opinion, and with enough time, practice and talent
you CAN recreate extremely complex images. I just don't share the opinion that
you should have to.

As for FH5 detecting this; It is not a "cheat", it is not giving any player
an unfair advantage, it is not modifying game files or game code, and it is
not taking advantage of any exploits.

Interpret that as you feel. I believe this is a missing necessary feature
from the vinyl group designer.
```
- **My version is older/newer or it isn't working following the steps!**
```
For unsupported versions, forza-painter will scan for a known pattern.
If it fails to find this pattern, it will notify you.
Most versions should work fine, but others may need tweaking.
```
- **Will you update this to support newer versions?**
```
It should automatically support newer versions, but in the case it doesn't let me know on Discord.
```
- **I have an error that I don't understand...**
```
Check the requirements above.
If you are still having problems, join the discord (top of readme) and ask for help in #support

# Basic usage guide:

## Making your template Vinyl Groups (reuse these):
- Open Forza Horizon 5 and create a new Vinyl Group.
- Just make one sphere and duplicate it for as many layers as you need. Color, size, scale, etc. **DO NOT MATTER**.
    - Tip (Optional): You can make (cut/insert) ~100 then select an existing shape, select highlight all, copy and insert these 100 over and over.
    - Tip (Optional): Another trick is to save one vinyl group with 6 groups of 500 spheres. Simply load it and delete the ones you don't want (e.g. to reduce it down to 2000 shapes, delete 2 of them), then ungroup.
- Save this as a template, as something identifiable, e.g. `forza-painter 3000 shapes`.

Note: When you load these templates the shapes will be **grouped**, make sure you select them and **UNGROUP** before using (If you miss one it will tell you).

## Using `forza-painter` to generate your `.json` geometry:
- Just drag one or multiple images onto `forza-painter.exe` and it will start
- It will generate a `.json` file in a folder with the same name and in same folder as the image(s) you dragged in. (most profiles will also save one every 500 shapes separately)
    - e.g. `C:\My Pics\happy.jpg` ‚Üí `C:\My Pics\happy\happy.json`
- You can close the window at any time when you are happy or if the shapes are complete.
- If more than one image is dragged in, it will queue them, completing them one by one.
- **Advanced Users:** Consider tweaking the profiles in the `settings` folder and share them with other users. See #faq on the Discord for more info.

## Importing your generated `.json` geometry files:
- Open Forza and load your template with the correct shape count
- Ungroup it
- Drag the `.json` file onto `forza-painter.exe`

## Importing hand made vinyls (shared by the community)
- Join the Discord
- Download a cool vinyl json (hand made in most cases by our community)
- Follow the steps above for importing like normal!
- Thank the awesome people in the Discord making these and sharing them!
    - Make your own and dump them with `_dump_vinyl_group_by_running_this.bat` ;)
